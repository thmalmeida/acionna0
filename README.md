# Acionna

Acionna is a firmware implementation to control and control and monitoring loads (machine, contactors, magnetic switch, etc). It can monitoring variables readed by sensors. The connection is over WiFi and based in websocket protocol.

# The system works above layers of control


# Features
	- intake air detect;

# TODO list:
- FSM valves needs works jointly with FSM machine control;
- enhance low pressure dectection:
	- broke main pipe;
    - while running some valve sector, identifies if has some broke pipe;
    - prevent occurs when change valve sector.
